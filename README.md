expect basic functionality before the last week of August

This is a gui program that guides you through the process of transfering your settings from a previous minecraft version to another one. Here is how it works:
  You select the setings file from the old version, and you select the settings file of the new version, if they happen to be in different folders. 
  If they have the same default directory, you do not need this
  If a setting in the old version also exists in the new one, it will be replaced with the old setting.
  For this to work best, it is important you have already installed the mods you will use in the new version.

  Warning: this program is built for windows
  Warning: the executable might not run even if on windows. If it doesn't, I dont know how to make it compatible.
